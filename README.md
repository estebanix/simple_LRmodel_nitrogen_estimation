This repository contains a simple example of a predictive model for stable isotopes. Specifically, it demonstrates how to predict values for the nitrogen isotope (δ15N) based on training data that includes carbon isotope (δ13C) values. This can be particularly useful in situations where nitrogen isotope data is missing, such as when only carbon isotope data from enamel carbonates is available, and collagen is not preserved.

The primary goal of this project is to illustrate the potential for predicting δ15N values using a linear regression model trained on δ13C data. This approach can be valuable when nitrogen isotope data is not available due to preservation issues or other constraints.
